NAAN MUDHALVAN-SPEECH TO TEXT PROJECT..


ABSTRACT

Speech-to-Text (STT) technology has emerged as a pivotal tool in bridging communication gaps across various domains, including healthcare, education, customer service, and accessibility. This project aims to develop an advanced STT system leveraging state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's Whisper and IBM Watson AI, to accurately transcribe audio inputs into text. The system is designed to handle diverse accents, background noise, and domain-specific terminology, ensuring high accuracy across multiple languages.
